# sometimes we have to seperate data based on conditions

# different methods of separation are
# simple train and test separation, k fold Cross Validation, Leave one out cross validation,
# Repeated random test-train separation
# 1. train_test_separate() - we specify some percent of data to train and test
# 2. K-fold - divide the data into parts and from that parts take training and testing data
